Typing/wordcount logic
- need to check to see if page has typing input box. Maybe check with user to make sure is correct page...? 
    if has typing input boxes, count ALL boxes and allow user to fight
    if has no typing input boxes, don't let user fight, but still let them adjust settings
    Maybe need information spot letting user know if page has typing input spaces?
    Start with simple wordcount counter
    chrome.tabs.onUpdate.addListener (view current tab?)
- START with just Docs. 
    Check to see if page is a google doc 
    When we fight, save that page as the current page? 
- What do if we lose the tab/typing box? Pause, send message
