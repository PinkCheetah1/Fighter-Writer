# Description
Writer Fighter is a chrome-based extension for writers that game-ifies typing in a timer-less, low-stress system. This program rewards consistency and progress rather than total results and relies entirely on rewards rather than punishment. This extension connects to any web-based text editor and allows users to play the game while typing in their prefered space. 

This idea is based off of a previous open-source project which can be found [here](https://github.com/cerey/fighters-block)
